# Full-Custom-Design-and-Layout-of-One-Bit-ALU-using-Cadence-Virtuoso
• Designed a 1 Bit ALU using Cadence Virtuoso 130 nm node technology (NCSU Library).
• Mirrored XOR circuits were used for optimizing the Full ADDER/SUBTRACTOR design and layout.
• Created standard cells for AND, OR, ADDER/SUBTRACTOR, and 4 x1 MUX. Verified DRC/LVS.
